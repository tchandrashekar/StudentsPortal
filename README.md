* This is a basic students portal project based on the java application int this portal i have created two options in my first main page as  student and faculty.
* Only the faculty can only update the details of student ,marks,exam dates and faculty can add the new students as well.
* To add students or updating the existing data the faculty should login first then he only he/she can access the faculty options.
